"vizio remote controller code"
This was a project I worked on as a side project during the summer of 2024. The code applies networking ideas, SSL certification, MDNS protocol and more.
Beforehand, I was not familiar with such concepts, but working on this project has given me a good experience and an in-depth knowledge of these concepts.
This project is not done yet. The pairing part is already implemented, but I can add more functionalities with the control features with simple API calls since the pairing and certification is already completed.
